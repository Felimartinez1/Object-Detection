# Object-Detection

It's a Simple Object Detection where the purpose is detect a car in an image. To carry out the task, I have used a Yolo algorithm and a set of training and testing images, aproximately 1175 total images. It's important to keep in mind that the model detects only one car per image, to make a model that detects more than one object per image you need a Multiple Object Detection model.
